      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>

      <h3>About this portfolio and me</h3>
      <p>
        Greetings! Welcome to my online portfolio, a space where I showcase the heart and soul of my photography and macramé endeavours! I'm Lina Simke, a passionate photographer and qualified midwife with a love for capturing life's beautiful moments. My journey is a blend of artistry and care, weaving together the worlds of photography and macramé. <br>
        Here, you'll find a visual journey through the stories I've had the honour to document and the knots I've carefully tied.
      </p>

      <h3>Photography: Capturing Life's Stories</h3>
      <p>
        As a photographer, my lens focuses on the magic of pregnancy, the warmth of families, and the miracle of home births. With a background in midwifery, I'm drawn to the profound beauty of bringing new life into the world. Each session is an opportunity to freeze these fleeting moments in time, creating memories that last a lifetime. <br>
        My photography sessions are primarily held in the embrace of nature, where the organic beauty of the outdoors complements the authenticity of the connections I capture. Except for the sacred space of birth, which is honoured within the safe walls of your home.
      </p>

      <h3>Macramé Magic: Knots of Creativity</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the camera, I find solace and joy in the art of macramé. With nimble fingers, I weave intricate creations that serve as both a hobby and an avenue for creative expression. Some pieces are crafted for the sheer joy of creating, while others find their way to an e-shop where they can become a part of your life. <br>
        As I continue to weave together my passions, stay tuned for the future launch of my e-shop, where you can bring a piece of this creativity into your own world.
        Thank you for being a part of this journey. Let's capture and create together.
